**OH BOY!! It's been a minute!**

But I am back. I redesigned the site. Actually, I completely rebuilt it.
It is now a <a href="https://remix.run/" target="_blank">Remix</a> app. I am sipping the React juice.
I may do a video or a blog post about why it's finally got me playing with
bloated frontend javascript. It's actually kinda neat.

I also added a new tool: [encode/decode](/encode-decode) for all your encoding
and decoding needs.

There are some tweaked (improved) existing tools, and I also added a breadcrumb nav
and a [blog archive](/blog), too.

. enjoy .
