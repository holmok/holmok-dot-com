**Always Need a First Post!**

So this is a work in progress. Please excuse the dust. I will try to
keep adding stuff to this and making useful things. Let's see how it goes.
Anyway, I do have some <a href="/utilities">cool utilities</a> you can
check out.

Here's a short **TODO** list:

- Add more utilities
- Write more posts
- Complete my about page
- Share coding projects
- Have fun
- Promote the site
